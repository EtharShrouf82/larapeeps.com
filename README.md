## About Larapeeps

Larapeeps is a place to find all the people you need to follow to stay up to date with the Laravel community. The goal of this project is to make it easy to find people to follow on Twitter, GitHub, and other platforms. You can also find links to their blogs, podcasts, and other projects.

## Adding a person

To add a person, clone this repository and run the following command:

```bash
php artisan person:add
```

This will ask you a series of questions about yourself. After running the command, you'll find your profile in `content/people/your-name.md`. If needed you can edit this file to add more information about yourself. When you're done, commit your changes and submit a pull request.
